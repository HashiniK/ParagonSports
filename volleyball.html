Very first in United States in 1895 had a match of volleyball and after that lot of countries gave a special place for this in their own countries and in their sports committees. <br><br>

    		There are two teams with six members in each play this with a large ball  in a court which is separated into two parts by a net. This game can be played as both indoor and outdoor game as mentioned above before. And it can be taken as an athletic sport also . There are some differences which help to separate whether it’s an outdoor one or an indoor one. Balls use in indoor playings are much heavier than outdoor balls and made by leather also.
